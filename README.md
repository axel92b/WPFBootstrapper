# WPFBootstrapper

A clean and empty WPF project with Autofac and Caliburn Micro integrated.

## How to use?
1) Create a view in the View folder as `SomethingView`.
2) Create an interface for ViewModel as `ISomethingViewModel.cs`.
3) Create a view model in the ViewModels folder as `SomethingViewModel.cs` and make it inherit from `ISomethingViewModel`.

And you are good to go. Also naming convention is critical for View/ViewModel.
